Pack transfer protocols
=======================

There are two Pack push-pull protocols.

upload-pack (S) | fetch/clone-pack (C) protocol:

	# Tell the puller what commits we have and what their names are
	S: SHA1 name
	S: ...
	S: SHA1 name
	S: # flush -- it's your turn
	# Tell the pusher what commits we want, and what we have
	C: want name
	C: ..
	C: want name
	C: have SHA1
	C: have SHA1
	C: ...
	C: # flush -- occasionally ask "had enough?"
	S: NAK
	C: have SHA1
	C: ...
	C: have SHA1
	S: ACK
	C: done
	S: XXXXXXX -- packfile contents.

----------------------------------------------------------------

send-pack | receive-pack protocol.

	# Tell the pusher what commits we have and what their names are
	C: SHA1 name (capabilities)
	C: ...
	C: SHA1 name
	C: # flush -- it's your turn
	# Tell the puller what the pusher has
	S: old-SHA1 new-SHA1 name
	S: old-SHA1 new-SHA1 name
	S: ...
	S: # flush -- done with the list
	S: XXXXXXX --- packfile contents.

When tellme-more extension is used:

	# Tell the pusher what commits we have and what their names are
	C: SHA1 name (capabilities)
	C: ...
	C: SHA1 name
	C: # flush -- it's your turn
	# Tell the puller what the pusher has
	S: old-SHA1 new-SHA1 name
	S: old-SHA1 new-SHA1 name
	S: tellme-more old-SHA1	-- I do not know about this one,
	S: tellme-more old-SHA1 -- give me ancestors of them.
	S: # flush -- done with the list
	# Tell the pusher more about history
	C: SHA1 old-SHA1 -- This is ancestor of that, you might know
	C: SHA1 old-SHA1
	C: ...
	C: # flush -- have you heard ehough?
	S: tellme-more old-SHA1' -- I still want to know more about this one
	S: # flush -- please give me more
	C: SHA1 old-SHA1'
	C: SHA1 old-SHA1'
	C: ...
	C: # flush -- have you heard ehough?
	S: # flush -- yes, thanks, we've heard enough
	S: XXXXXXX --- packfile contents.

1. Receiver sends its refs and advertises its capabilities.

2. Sender sends its intention to update which refs from what old value to
   what new value.

3. Sender can choose to do tellme-more conversation or choose not to.

3-a. If Sender chooses to ask tellme-more questions, then it sends one or
     more "tellme-more SHA-1", and ends them with a flush.  The parties
     move to state #4.

3-b. If Sender does not want to ask tellme-more questions, it sends a
     flush.  The parties move to state #5.

4. Receiver can choose to continue tellme-more conversation, or it can
   choose to terminate it.

4-a. If Receiver chooses to continue tellme-more conversation, it responds
     with sequence of "ancestor SHA-1".  The SHA-1 should match one of the
     SHA-1 Sender asked about with its tellme-more request.  It ends them
     with a flush.  The parties move to state #3.

4-b. If Receiver chooses to terminate tellme-more conversation, it sends a
     flush.  The parties move to state #3 (and implicitly asks Sender to
     choose #3-b).

5. Receiver awaits the packfile contents to come.  Sender sends the
   packfile payload.
